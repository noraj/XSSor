# User guide - how to use?

1.     After installation, the XSSor tab will be added to Burp.
2.     Open the configuration tab (XSSorà Configuration) and turn XSSor on.
3.     Browse to the tested website and write the XSS keyword (the default is `xssme` in the tested parameter).
4.     XSSor will send the same request (or multiple requests if in **brute force** mode) to the tested website with the defined payload (or multiple payloads in case of BT mode).
5.     XSSor will add a row for each payload, and the status; if it is vulnerable or not.
 
# Vulnerable status column

There are 3 options:

1.     N - Not vulnerable
2.     Yes (Reflected XSS) - The malicious payload was found in the response of the tested page.
3.     Yes (Persistent XSS) - The malicious payload was found in the response of one of the affected pages.
 
# Affected pages

The **affected pages** feature was designed in order to find persistent XSS flaws. By adding this feature, XSSor will check if the malicious payload is found in the affected page's responses.
 
In order to add affected pages, right-click on the request and click on **XSSor: Add affected page** as shown in the following image:
